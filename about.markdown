# About Our Services

Wallrazer can be contracted for work in the following areas:

### Site Design & Development

We have over a decade and a half of experience in designing, developing, and managing web sites and blogs. We can help you determine your needs, select a software platform or CMS, and build out a site as a trusted partner. Our goal is to make sure that your site represents you and your company.

### Web Application Development

Your business may have a custom web application, or even provide a web application as a service. We can provide a variety of contract services to help you advance your application:

- Feature design
- Front End Development (HTML/Javascript)
- Backend web programming (Python, Django, Perl)
- DevOps Services (continuous integration, application metrics setup, etc.)

See what we're up to on [Github](https://github.com/wallrazer).

### Something Else?

Perhaps you don't know yet what you need, but just want someone to sit down and talk about your business, vision, goals, or technology requirements. We'd love to help you focus your efforts in a way that will open up new opportunities for you.
