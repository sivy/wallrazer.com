# About Our Services

Wallrazer can be contracted for work in the following areas:

### Site Design &amp; Development

Wallrazer's Principle and Founder, Steve Ivy, has been designing and coding for the Web since the early days, when "web pages" were simple and GIFs came in 256 glorious colors. That means nearly 20 years of experience in planning, creating and managing dynamic websites and weblogs. We can help you:

* Define the results your site should deliver
* If needed, help select a software platform or content management system for your site
* Build out your site as a trusted partner

With this depth of experience we will deliver a site that best represents you and your company. <a href="mailto:steve@wallrazer.com?subject=Site%20Quote">Request a Quote</a>.

### Web Application Development / Coding Services

Sometimes your web application team may just need an extra resource to reach the next milestone. Wallrazer can provide a variety of contract services to help you get there:

- Feature design
- Front end development (HTML/Javascript)
- Backend web programming (Python, Django, Perl)
- DevOps services (continuous integration, application metrics setup, etc.)

### Something Else?

Perhaps you don't know yet what you need, but just want someone to sit down and talk about your business, vision, goals, or technology requirements. We can help you focus your efforts in a way that will open up new opportunities for you. <a href="mailto:steve@wallrazer.com">Get in touch</a> and let's talk about your needs.

# Pushcode

<span style="float:right; margin: 0 0 30px 30px"><a style="text-decoration:none; border: none; color: #333; background: #fff" href="https://pushco.de"><img src="/images/pushcode_small.png" /></a></span>

Wallrazer runs [Pushcode](http://pushco.de), a continuous deployment app for small design and development shops.

Steve shares some thoughts on Pushcode:

>I've done a lot of design/development work. For many of the sites I was designing and building everything, and the sites always required lots of changes and updates over time. When working on several of those at a time, I always ended up with a collage of stickies and Notepad docs describing how to push out changes to the sites, since I could never keep them in my head (too crowded!).

>Pushcode was conceived to address this dilemma. Now we can simply setup an application and deployment environment in Pushcode, and add a deploy key to the server. Then it's a matter of committing all changes to VCS (you are using source control, right?), then log into Pushcode and push a button. Lather, rinse, repeat.

Pushcode is in private beta; if you'd like to take it for a spin, feel free to ping Steve at <steve@pushco.de>.

[Pushcode](/) is built with [Python](http://python.org), [Django](http://djangoproject.org), [Fabric](http://fabfile.org), [Celery](http://ask.github.com/celery/), [Redis](http://redis.io), [Linode](http://linode.com), [Less](http://http://lesscss.org/) and love.
