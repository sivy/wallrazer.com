<h1>Welcome to the new Wallrazer.com</h1>
<div class="content">
	<p>The start of something new is always a scary time. This year (01/01/2011) I decided to start off on my own as an independent contractor. After a career working for various companies both small and large, I decided that I was ready to take the leap.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m doing contract web development, largely in Movable Type, python, and django. I&#8217;ve got several steady clients that are keeping me busy about 3/4 of the time, which is pretty good for the first couple months. I&#8217;m in the process of re-evaluating all my tools and processes; now that I&#8217;m independent I don&#8217;t have as much time to spend poking at tools.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also got some product ideas rolling around in my head, and I&#8217;m excited to see if any of them can come to fruition in the near future. It&#8217;s going to be an interesting year!</p>
