title: MT Related Items Plugin
---

I recently completed the first version of a Related Items plugin for Byrne Reese and [Endevver](http://endevver.com). This plugin provides a new custom field that can be used along with a template tag to pull in related objects (entries, pages, or most anything that is taggable) for an entry or page, based on tags you provide. From the readme:

>Related Items provides a custom field that allows users to relate entries or assets (or any Taggable objects) to the current entry by way of a set of tags. After adding the custom field to a blog, a set of tags can be entered in the field. In blog templates, the RelatedItems block tag can be used to pull in the related entries, pages, or assets in an object loop to be rendered in the template.

Read more about the plugin, usage, etc on Github: [Related Items](https://github.com/sivy/mt-plugin-related-items).

Related Items is released under the perl license.
